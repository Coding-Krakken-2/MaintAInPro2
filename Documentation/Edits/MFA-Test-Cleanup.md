# MFA Test & Cleanup Summary

**Date:** 2025-07-16

## What Changed

- Cleaned up `LoginMFA.test.tsx` to remove unused imports and ensure all mocks are up to date.
- Suppressed noisy React warnings in test output for a cleaner CI/dev experience.
- Confirmed all MFA-related tests are comprehensive: login, validation, MFA flow, error handling,
  and demo credentials.
- Ensured all tests pass and code style is consistent.

## Why

- To maintain a stable, maintainable, and warning-free test suite for the Login MFA flow.
- To ensure future contributors have clear, reliable tests and minimal distraction from warnings.

## Next Steps

- Continue to run all tests after any change.
- Update documentation and test coverage as new MFA features are added.
