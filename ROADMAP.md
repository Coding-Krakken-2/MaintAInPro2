# MaintAInPro CMMS - Enterprise Development Roadmap

## üéØ Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the comprehensive development plan to transform the current MaintAInPro CMMS
foundation into a production-ready, enterprise-grade maintenance management system. The project will
be delivered in 4 phases over 12 weeks, implementing 8 core modules with advanced features including
offline capabilities, real-time collaboration, predictive analytics, and multi-tenant architecture.

**Current State**: Solid foundation (15-20% complete) with React/TypeScript infrastructure, Supabase
backend, and basic UI components. **Critical Gap**: No mobile compatibility, offline functionality,
or core business logic.

**Target State**: Enterprise-ready CMMS with comprehensive work order management, preventive
maintenance automation, asset tracking, inventory management, and advanced reporting capabilities.

**Latest Update**: July 18, 2025 - Comprehensive analysis reveals significant gaps between current
implementation and vision requirements. Infrastructure is solid but core modules need complete
implementation.

**CRITICAL FINDINGS**:

- 0% mobile compatibility (vision requires 90% mobile usage)
- 0% offline functionality (vision requires 100% offline capability)
- 95% of work order functionality missing
- No QR code system implementation
- No business logic or workflow automation
